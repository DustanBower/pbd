pbd is a small set of scripts for daemonizing pianobar.

pbd requires:

1) python
2) pianobar
3) screen
4) notification-daemon (or xfce4-notifyd)
5) dmenu
6) pgrep

notification-daemon must be running (possibly requiring manual spawning) in order for the user to see notifications.  xfce4-notifyd spawns itself, but doesn't look as nice.

pbd also requires pianobar configuration:

keybindings:

pbd expects the default keybindings.  If they have been changed,
undefined behavior may result.  pbd has to intercept certain
commands to make them work properly ('s' is a prime example)

The "?" command is intercepted by pbd, and displays the current
station, artist, and song title.

.config/pianobar/ctl must exist:

$ mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

.config/pianobar/config should contain:
user = <your user name>
password = <your password>
autostart_station = <pick one (this may change)>
event_command = <location of pbevent script*>

* (should be /usr/bin/pbevent)

INSTALLATION:

with root permissions:

MAKE SURE TO USE PYTHON2

<python 2.x> setup.py install

on most systems, that will be:

python setup.py install

on arch:

python2 setup.py install



USAGE:

If invoked without parameters, pbd will:

1) Activate pianobar, if it is not running.
2) prompt the user for input via dmenu

pbd can be invoked with options too, for further flexibility:

"pbd s1" should load the appropriate station without prompting.
(only station numbers will work in this way, however)

type or select ":help" (or invoke pbd with the :help parameter) to see a help
display.   pbd doesn't use - or -- options to avoid confusion with - and
accidentally banning songs.


pbd is intended to be bound to a key for invocation.  On my system, I use
mod+m (m for Music).  An example of usage:

mod+m (to start)
mod+m (dmenu:)+<enter> (love song)
mod+m (dmenu:)n<enter> (next song)
mod+m (dmenu:)-<enter> (ban song)
mod+m (dmenu:)s<enter>(dmenu:)In Flames<enter>

dmenu supports infix matching, so selecting station "6) In Flames" can be
accomplished by typing "6", "In", "Flames", etc.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
?: show current song
n: next song
s: change station
p: pause
+: love song
-: ban song
t: tired of this song
q: quit

:help	Show help message.



TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Nearly every problem I've had or heard of involving pbd is a problem with notification-daemon.  When pbd starts, little magical boxes should pop up, telling you the name of the song playing and various other nonsense.  These boxes should fade after about 5 seconds, with the exception of the help message, which shows for 10.

If you're not seeing these, there is a problem with notifications not working.  Possible reasons include: notification-daemon didn't bother to start itself, in which case you can look for it in /usr/lib/notification-daemon-1.0/notification-daemon, or similar.

If you've done that, and the notifications stop appearing, it's probably crashed, which can be fixed by:

1) closing pbd
2) sending notification-daemon a kill signal
3) restarting pbd.
4) (optional) incomprehensible angry muttering

That will fix the problem for somewhere between 3 seconds and 5 minutes.

Or you can just delete notification-daemon and install xfce4-notifyd, which hopefully is less fussy.
