pbd 0.1.2
---------
    - explain works well enough, will need to see if further interaction
    	with pianobar will allow support for more pianobar features without
	undue headaches.

pbd 0.1.1
---------
    - I really need to add another way to communicate with the user,
        since notification daemon likes to break.  Maybe zenity?

pbd 0.1.0
---------
    - Most of pianobar's features aren't supported at present.  pbd
        should be expanded to support more of these.  This will
	likely require changes to pianobar, however.
